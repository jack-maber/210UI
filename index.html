							  <h2>Methods</h2>
							</header>

							<p> I started my research by constructing a set of interview questions about the game's interface, as I felt that this would be the best way of gaining insight into the pre-exisitng problems with the interface, and although the results I gained did give me a few points to work with, I wish I had made my questions more general as I think it would be easier to make connections between the findings of my later research methods, as although qualitative allows me to gain a better understanding of what my audience is thinking during gameplay, it is hard to draw more general conclusions, which would have been helpful when constructing my Questionnaire. My sample size for this piece of research was 3 people, as I felt that was the minimum amount of people that would be required to start to find problems within the timeframe of the assignment, and also leave me with enough time to complete my other research.
						    </p>
							
							<p>My Quantitative research was made up of more focused questions about the user interface, specifically about the tutorial, which was an issue I found that all of the people who took my questionnaire brought up, so I felt it would be best to research more into this specifically as it is a very important piece of user interface when playing a new game, as otherwise the player won't know what to do. I asked 20 people about the interface as this I was told was the optimum number of people to ask, and as these anwsers were more tailoured, it gave me much more focused results, which is exactly what I need to draw effective conclusions, however I made the mistake of using multiple choice anwsers rather than a 1 - 5 scale, which made it harder to turn into graphs and see correlations, but it can still be done. 
							</p>

							<p>
							My last evaluation method was Task Evaluation, where I asked a person to undertake a certain task, and then asked them to talk out loud the process they were undertaking, I then wrote down exactly what they said this gave me much more insight into the actual process that the player would undertake during gameplay, this gave me some very interesting results about the smaller details that can crop up, such as "false flags" with the UI that look like options but are actually just text, which seemed to annoy all of the players, which is insight I would never have gained without using this method, so it was defiently a good choice, but I think I could have asked them to undertake more tasks, as this would have uncovered more issues with the UI, but due to time constraints I was unable to, utilising video or screen capture for this piece of research would also have been optimal, however I found that the player base I was using didn't want to partake in filming, which affects the validity of my results, but they still hold some useful merit when it comes to drawing conclusions, however I would defienetly consider using video next time as it defiently helps when pointing out problems with the UI as the viewer can actually see the player using the iterface.

							  <h2>Results</h2>
							</header>

							

							<p> My Qualitative results brought back some interesting problems with the game, the first being that the tutorial was not layed out in a way that is easily remembered, as it is layed out in a slideshow like fashion, with players noting that it was hard to remember the movement controls that were at the start of the tutorial, which lead them to then struggle to play the game first time around, as they struggled to recall the controls, along with the fact that I discovered that some of the controls are misrepresented in the tutorial, leading to even more confusion from the player. </p>
							
							<p>Following on from my Qualitative research, my questionnaire further developed on the problems that I had found with the interface in my first round of research, I asked the players again if there would be a better method of posing the tutorial to the player, and the most popular was a "guided" walkthrough, with the "lock-out" method closely behind, but I feel that both of these methods would be of greater use than the one featured in the game, as almost all of the players still struggled to remember any of the controls during gameplay, to find out exactly what the player was thinking when using the interface, I next decided to undertake some task analysis to  better understand the way players expect the UI to work in the game
							</p>
							
							<p>My task analysis was useful in finding smaller issues with the UI, such as the fact that the "join" button in the player select screen doesn't actually do anything, which players found very odd, and very annoying as they then had to then look around the screen for the correct key to press to join the game, while some players just expected it to be space, as that was the "logical" button apparently, but it ended up being enter, which in my mind doesn't make all that much sense"
